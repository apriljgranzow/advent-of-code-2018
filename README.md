# Advent of Code 2018
From the Advent of Code Website:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I will be attempting to leaderboard for my first time participating in this event.  This means my initial code will be in Python and may be very hacky or messy but I try to make it efficient to practice usage of appropriate data structures and algorithms.

When I have time I intend to go back and redo challenges in a functional style using either Haskell or Clojure to learn more about the languages and strengthen my ability to solve problems using functional programming paradigms.
